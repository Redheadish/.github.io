## Context
Reliability is not a feature and not a state.
It is an ongoing engineering process.

## Core idea
Chaos is not an exception — it is the baseline.
Systems degrade, dependencies fail, assumptions rot.

Reliability exists only where failure is expected and managed.

## Practical notes
- Automate recovery, not heroics
- Treat incidents as data
- Assume every component will fail

## Key takeaways
- Chaos is normal
- Reliability is deliberate
- Automation beats optimism
